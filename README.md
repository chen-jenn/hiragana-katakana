# Hiragana and Katakana Quiz - WIP
In other words, an exact copy of https://www.gyford.com/japanese/, built using React. Type your answers in Romaji

## Tech Stack
* create-react-app
* scss

## TO DO:

1. Only pick value from the array of characters once. Without modifying the original "readings" data object
2. Don't let progress bar go beyond 100% lol
3. At end of the quiz, the submit button turns into a reset button (might solve the issue of going beyond 100%)
